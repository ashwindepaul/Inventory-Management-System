ðŸ“¦ Inventory Management & Broker Service (Spring Boot)
ðŸ“– Overview

This project is a microservice-ready Inventory Management & Broker System built with Spring Boot.
It acts as a middleman company that:

Handles suppliers (who provide products in bulk).

Handles customers/buyers (who purchase products).

Uses brokers (who manage deals between suppliers and customers).

The system records transactions (purchases & sales), manages products, suppliers, users, and provides search & reporting features.

5. Current Architecture

Right now, youâ€™ve structured it monolithically, but preparing for microservices:

ProductController, TransactionController, etc.

Business logic inside Services.

DTOs for request/response handling.
